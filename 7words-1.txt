The eavestrough sagged under the weight of seasons of neglect.
The arc of the parabola was high.
She had run afoul of the systems that regulated such things.
The blindingly effulgent sun hurt his eyes.
The awesome scale terrified the young man.
She was preparing the cake with alacrity.
She read the triolet loudly.

Under the weight of seasons of neglect, pressed by rain and wind, drained of color by the sun's relentless shine, the eavestrough sagged, bowed, and finally detached from the roof in a jarring and surprisingly quiet fall to the ground, landing with a low thud that would have seemed plain if you had only seen its aftermath, but that produced a dull sort of shock to those observing.
